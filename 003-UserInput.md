# User Input
Most of the time a computer needs to take some input from a user in order for it to be useful.  We're going to spend some time looking at different ways this is done.  We'll also implement a simple user input program in QBasic.

## What is User Input?
User input can be almost anything the user does.  It might be mouse clicks, it might be button presses on a game pad, it might be keyboard, it might be microphone.  Whatever your app is intending to do you can bet that you'll need to handle some input from a user.

## See it in action
Ok open up https://repl.it/languages/QBasic save the new session with some meaningful name, maybe 003-user-input.

##### A new keyword INPUT
In a simple command line QBasic application like this, getting input from the user is very simple.  We'll use the `INPUT` keyword.  The format is something like this:

```
INPUT "Message to the user", variable
```

This causes the command line to prompt the user for some input, the input is then stored as the value of `variable`.

##### Simple app
We're going to write a very basic program which will prompt the user for some input, then return the uppercased version of whatever the user typed in.

```
DIM test AS STRING

INPUT "Please type a message to be upper cased:", test

PRINT "Here you go..."
PRINT UCASE$(test)
```

This is all stuff you know already!  Except the new keyword `INPUT` and we are using a **build in** function called `UCASE$` this takes in a string and will output the uppercase version of that string.  Go ahead and â–¶ Run.  Type some input into your program and hit enter.

Play around with this as much as you want.  Once your'e done, click the "share" button and send me a link to your repl.it session.
